I've been working at Intuitive.AI for almost 3 years. I have expertise in designing and deploying robust ML pipelines using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow frameworks. I'm mostly involved in optimizing ML and data processing workflows for efficiency and scalability using Apache Beam and Dataflow. Besides work, I like to spend my time sketching or painting.
