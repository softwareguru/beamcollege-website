Currently, I am Engineering Manager for the Apache Beam team at Google. Over the past two decades, my focus has been on extensive large-scale data processing, machine learning / deep learning frameworks, and practical applications such as intelligent document processing. Furthermore, I identify as a machine learning practicalist and derive great enthusiasm from harnessing machine learning to empower society!
