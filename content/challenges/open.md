summary: "Build any solution you want using Apache Beam."
---

#### Justification
Apache Beam is a versatile and powerful tool for a wide array of data processing tasks. This open challenge encourages participants to think creatively and apply Beam to novel use cases, solve unique problems, or explore interesting datasets.

#### Objective
Propose and implement an interesting data processing task or build a solution for an innovative use case using Apache Beam. This is an opportunity to showcase creativity and the flexibility of Beam.

#### Things to consider
 * Identify a unique problem or an interesting dataset.
 * Design a Beam pipeline to address the chosen task.
 * Consider batch or streaming data processing.
 * Think about potential real-world applications or impact.
 * Clearly articulate the problem, solution, and results.

#### Expected result
A working Apache Beam pipeline (runnable in Colab or on Dataflow) that implements the proposed data processing task. Participants should be prepared to present their use case, the design of their pipeline, and the outcomes or insights derived.
