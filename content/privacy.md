Beam College collects some personal data from its users. We take great care in collecting only the minimum data that we need to provide the service and to manage this data adequately. This document provides more details about the data we gather and how it is used.


#### Data controller

The legal entity responsible for Beam College is:

Nearshore Link, Inc.
2940 Thousand Oaks Dr.
Austin, TX 78746

Contact: Pedro Galvan <pedro@sg.com.mx>



#### Contact forms

In order to register for the webinars and training promoted in this website we ask participants to register by providing their name, contact email as well as profile information like company name and job role. Individual contact information (name and email) is only used for the purpose of allowing participants to join the webinars and is not shared with any 3rd party.


### How we use your data

The information that you provide when registering for a webinar is divided in two groups and treated differently: 

 * Personal contact information (name and email). This is used exclusively to provide you access to the webinars and is not shared with any 3rd parties. 

 * Profile information (company, job title, country). This is aggregated to generate statistics that are shared with partners. No information to identify userâ€™s individually is shared.


#### Cookies & embedded content

We do not directly use cookies. However, some 3rd party services whose content we embed, may use cookies, including:
 * Typeform (registration)
 * Google Analytics
 * YouTube (recorded sessions)

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.


#### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
