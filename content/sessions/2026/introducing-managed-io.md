Discover what makes Managed IO a major leap towards a more unified, flexible, and upgrade-friendly connector ecosystem. This talk dives into the motivation and design behind Managed IO, highlighting a few key goals:

• Provide a consistent API across all connectors
• Enable runners to seamlessly upgrade IOs, pulling in bug fixes and new features — all with zero user effort
• Allow runners to fine-tune connector behavior for their environment
