You will learn how to build a pipeline that processes video data in real time to enable efficient analysis and event or anomaly detection.
 - Reads video streams or recorded footage from the source    
 - Applies sliding-window analysis to examine activity over short intervals    
 - Uses stateful processing to track patterns and detect anomalies over time

Finally, it raises alerts or stores annotated events in a structured format that can be used for monitoring dashboards or downstream analysis.

An example of a use case could be in monitoring traffic using surveillance footage to detect any unusual event like accident or disabled vehicle, etc.
