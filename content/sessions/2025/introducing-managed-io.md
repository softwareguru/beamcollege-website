Discover what makes Managed IO a major leap towards a more unified, flexible, and upgrade-friendly connector ecosystem. This talk dives into the motivation and design behind Managed IO, highlighting a few key goals:

 • Provide a consistent API across all connectors
 • Enable runners to seamlessly upgrade IOs, pulling in bug fixes and new features — all with zero user effort
 • Allow runners to fine-tune connector behavior for their environment

See it all in action with a Dataflow demo featuring IcebergIO as a case study, alongside examples with BigQueryIO and KafkaIO!
